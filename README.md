## ✍️ Blog: How I Use MCP and Cursor Rules

> Cursor has transformed the way I approach coding, and in this blog post, I want to share my personal workflow, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers I utilize, and how I've structured my Cursor rules to boost my productivity and coding efficiency.

### ⚙️ MCP Servers and Where to Get Them

One of Cursor's strengths lies in its extensibility through MCP servers. I found several incredibly useful MCP servers on [Smithery.ai](https://smithery.ai/).  
Here's a quick overview of the servers I rely on daily:

- 🔍 **Brave Search** – Powerful web search directly in Cursor.
- 🧠 **Server Sequential Thinking** – Great for structured logic and step-by-step workflows.
- 🤖 **Puppeteer** – Automates browser tasks, scraping, and web interaction.
- 🔥 **Firecrawl** – Excellent for scraping, mapping, and data extraction.
- 🗂️ **Browser Tabs** – Manage tabs programmatically for multitasking and flow.

### 🧩 My Customized Cursor Rules Journey

I started by adopting the PRD-focused rule setup from  
🎥 [JeredBlu’s YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41xaJsJ8GVc&ab_channel=JeredBlu).

Then, I refined my rules further after reading  
🧠 ["AI Blindspots" by ezyang](https://ezyang.github.io/ai-blindspots/), which inspired me to address specific limitations in AI-assisted coding.

### 📄 Access My Complete Cursor Rules

All of my global rules are available in a single file:  
➡️ [`coding-best-practices.mdc`](https://github.com/KalinYorgov/cursor-notebook/blob/main/coding-best-practices.mdc)

Use it freely as a reference or starting point for your own rule set.

### 🛠️ Adding Project-Specific Rules

When starting a new project:

1. I clarify the tech stack.
2. I pull relevant Cursor rules from  
   🔗 [awesome-cursorrules](https://github.com/PatrickJS/awesome-cursorrules?tab=readme-ov-file#contents) by PatrickJS.

This targeted method keeps my rules lean, relevant, and effective.

### ✅ Conclusion

Setting up Cursor effectively has:

- 🚀 Boosted my coding workflow
- 🧠 Increased clarity and efficiency
- 📈 Elevated the quality of AI-assisted output

I hope this helps you build your own powerful Cursor workflow!  
Feel free to share your own tips — I’d love to learn from your journey too.
